Aspell extra dictionary for Drupal

Run M-x drupal-spell-enable to setup the Drupal dictionary as an extra
dictionary in that buffer.

The command will be enabled automatically when activating drupal-mode.

Installation

The easiest way to install Drupal spell is probably to install it via
the ELPA packages at Marmalade or MELPA.

ELPA (package.el) is part of Emacs 24. For Emacs 23 see Marmalade for
installation instructions.

Dependencies

You need to use aspell as your spell checker as ispell does not support
the use of extra dictionaries.

Development of Drupal spell

Drupal spell is actively developed at GitHub. Feature requests, ideas,
bug reports, and pull request are more than welcome!
